# Smart contract reference

The smart contract source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/88mphapp/88mph-contracts).

## Architecture overview

Each 88mph pool consists of 6 smart contracts:

- `DInterest`: The main smart contract that users interact with. Handles depositing, withdrawing, and keeping track of deposits. Emits all of the events used in the subgraph.
- `FeeModel`: Determines the fee strategy of 88mph, as well as who receives the fees.
- `MoneyMarket`: A wrapper for interacting with yield-generating protocols, and stores all of the user funds. Requires a different one for each protocol.
- `InterestOracle`: An oracle for the interest rate of the underlying yield-generating protocol.
- `NFT`: Two non-fungible ERC721 tokens, used for representing ownership of deposits and bonds.

Globally 88mph has the following contracts for handling things related to the MPH token:

- `MPHToken`: The MPH ERC-20 token contract itself.
- `MPHMinter`: Responsible for minting & taking back MPH tokens for depositors & bond buyers.
- `Dumper`: Responsible for accumulating the protocol fees & yield-farming rewards generated by 88mph pools and exchanging them for DAI.
- `Rewards`: The MPH rewards staking contract for distributing the protocol fees & yield-farming rewards.

## API reference

### DInterest

#### State changing functions

##### `function deposit(uint256 amount, uint256 maturationTimestamp) external`

Creates a single deposit for the caller.

- `amount`: The amount of `stablecoin` to deposit. The caller should have already approved the contract to spend this much `stablecoin` before calling this function. Scaled by \(10^{stablecoinDecimals}\).
- `maturationTimestamp`: The Unix timestamp at and after which the deposit will be able to be withdrawn. In seconds.

##### `function withdraw(uint256 depositID, uint256 fundingID) external`

Withdraws a single deposit for the caller. The caller must own the deposit NFT with ID `depositID`.

- `depositID`: The index of the deposit to be withdrawn in the `deposits` array plus 1.
- `fundingID`: The index of the funding object that funded the deposit's debt in the `fundingList` array plus 1. It can be found using our [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/bacon-labs/eighty-eight-mph).

###### Important note

Withdrawing may fail if the 88mph pool has failed to generate enough interest from the underlying money market to cover the deficit incurred by the original upfront interest payout, and no one has funded the difference by buying bonds. This is the main risk of depositing into 88mph.

##### `function earlyWithdraw(uint256 depositID, uint256 fundingID) external`

Withdraws a single deposit for the caller, before the maturation timestamp. The caller must own the deposit NFT with ID `depositID`.

- `depositID`: The index of the deposit to be withdrawn in the `deposits` array plus 1.
- `fundingID`: The index of the funding object that funded the deposit's debt in the `fundingList` array plus 1. It can be found using our [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/bacon-labs/eighty-eight-mph).

##### `function multiDeposit(uint256[] calldata amountList, uint256[] calldata maturationTimestampList) external`

Deposits multiple deposits for the caller. The values at each index in each array will be combined to create a single deposit.

- `amountList`: An array of the amounts of `stablecoin` to deposit. The caller should have already approved the contract to spend this much `stablecoin` before calling this function. Scaled by \(10^{stablecoinDecimals}\).
- `maturationTimestampList`: An array of the Unix timestamps at and after which the deposits will be able to be withdrawn. In seconds.

###### Input size limit

The maximum recommended number of deposits is 20.

##### `function multiWithdraw(uint256[] calldata depositIDList, uint256[] calldata fundingIDList) external`

Withdraws multiple deposits for the caller. The caller must own the deposit NFTs with IDs in `depositIDList`.

- `depositIDList`: The indices of the deposits to be withdrawn in the `deposits` array plus 1.
- `fundingIDList`:  The indices of the funding objects that funded the deposit's debt in the `fundingList` array plus 1. It can be found using our [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/bacon-labs/eighty-eight-mph).

###### Input size limit

The maximum recommended number of deposits is 100.

###### Important note

Withdrawing may fail if the 88mph pool has failed to generate enough interest from the underlying money market to cover the deficit incurred by the original upfront interest payout, and no one has funded the difference. This is the main risk of depositing into 88mph. If withdrawing actually fails, `earlyWithdraw()` may be called to get back the deposit minus the upfront interest and fee.

##### `function multiEarlyWithdraw(uint256[] calldata depositIDList, uint256[] calldata fundingIDList) external`

Withdraws multiple deposits for the caller, before the maturation timestamp. The caller must own the deposit NFTs with IDs in `depositIDList`.

- `depositIDList`: The indices of the deposits to be withdrawn in the `deposits` array plus 1.
- `fundingIDList`:  The indices of the funding objects that funded the deposit's debt in the `fundingList` array plus 1. It can be found using our [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/bacon-labs/eighty-eight-mph).

###### Input size limit

The maximum recommended number of deposits is 50.

##### `function fundAll() external`

Allows the caller to fund all of the existing deficit of the 88mph pool. In exchange, the caller receives a funding NFT, and the interest generated by the deposits the caller funded will be sent to the owner of the NFT whenever a deposit they funded is withdrawn.

Before calling this function, the caller must approve at least the deficit amount of `stablecoin` to the `DInterest` contract. This amount may be obtained using [`surplus()`](#function-surplus-external-view-returns-bool-isnegative-uint256-surplusamount). To avoid the transaction being reverted, it is recommended to simply set the approval amount to \(2^{256}-1\).

##### `function fundMultiple(uint256 toDepositID) external`

Allows the caller to fund the deficit of multiple deposits. In exchange, the caller receives a funding NFT, and the interest generated by the deposits the caller funded will be sent to the owner of the NFT whenever a deposit they funded is withdrawn.

Before calling this function, the caller must approve at least the deficit amount of `stablecoin` to the `DInterest` contract. This amount may be obtained using [`surplusOfDeposit()`](#function-surplusofdeposituint256-depositid-external-view-returns-bool-isnegative-uint256-surplusamount). To avoid the transaction being reverted, it is recommended to simply set the approval amount to \(2^{256}-1\).
