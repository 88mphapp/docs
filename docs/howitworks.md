# 88mph的运作策略
## 概览
What exactly happens when you, say, deposit 100 DAI into 88mph for 1 year at 10% fixed-rate APY?
如果你把100DAI存进88mph平台，存期一年，按10%的固定利率计算收益，会发生什么变化？
1. Your 100 DAI is transferred to 88mph.
1. 你的100 DAI存进了88mph。
2. 88mph deposits the 100 DAI into a yield-generating protocol with variable rate APY, which will generate yield for the 1 year deposit period.
2. 88mph把这100 DAI存进另一个按照可变利率计算年收益率的交易平台，该平台负责在这一年存期中产生实际收益。
3. Once the 1 year is over, you withdraw 110 DAI from 88mph.
3.一年期满后，你可以从88mph中取出110 DAI。
At first glance, this may seem extremely problematic. To begin with, how is this different from simply juggling your own money around? Secondly, if the yield-generating protocol failed to generate 10 DAI of yield from the 100 DAI given to it in 1 year, you can't guarantee that you can withdraw 110 DAI from 88mph.
乍看之下，这似乎疑虑重重。首先，这跟移花接木的欺诈有什么区别？其次，如果这个实际收益产出平台在一年内无法产生10 DAI的收益，88mph似乎无法确保用户一年后能拿到110 DAI。
These objections are resolved by 88mph through pooling the deposits together. Pooling deposits means putting the deposited DAI into a single pool, from which users can withdraw a deposit once its deposit period is over.
将所有用户的存款的集中到一起，我们可以解决这些问题。将所有存款整合到一起就意味着所有DAI都集中到一个单独的池子中，存期满时用户从这个资金池中取款。
How would pooling help?
为什么把资金集中在一起就能解决问题？
- **Risk balancing**: If the floating rate APY rose after a deposit, the yield generated by the deposited funds could be more than the interest promised to the user. This surplus would be able to balance out the debt caused by deposits where the floating rate has dropped since the time of deposit. This way, risk of insolvency is reduced for the users, and the stability of 88mph's interest rate is supported.
- **风险平衡**：假如我们将一笔资金转入该实际收益平台后，利率有所上涨，那么实际产生的收益就会多于向用户承诺的收益，增加的这部收益就能用来平衡某些用户存入资金后由于利率下跌而造成的负债。这样就能有效降低破产的风险，从而增加88mph固定利率的稳定性。
- **Overlapping deposit periods**: If an older deposit could not generate enough yield to cover the debt caused by the interest promised to the depositor, and its deposit period would be over soon, the yield could still be paid out using the funds of other deposits. This alone obviously does not solve the debt, but combined with risk balancing and the volatility in the floating interest rate it helps with keeping the 88mph pool solvent.
- **重叠存期**：如果一笔较先的存款无法产出足够的收益，而其存期又即将结束，这时可调用其他存款资金以优先结算这笔即将到期的存款。显然，单独通过这种办法无法解决所有负债问题，但结合风险平衡和利率浮动两种手段，则能有效保证88mph平台的偿付能力。
## Floating-rate bonds
## 浮动利率债券
Simply doing the above, though, would make 88mph a fairly risky product: if the floating rate APY drops to a very low value and stays there for a long time, deposits made when the floating rate was still high would not by themselves generate enough interest to cover the original interest payouts, and neither would the deposits made after the rates dropped help with this situation. This would cause a pool-wide insolvency event.
如果只是简单地如上述所言，88mph依旧是一个高风险的平台：假如浮动利率跌到超低值且停滞了很长时间，而用户在一个利率较高的时候存入资金，这些资金将无法在存期内自给自足其收益，降息后的存款更无助于偿付收益，这将导致整个资金池的破产。
This is why 88mph also offers another mechanic called **floating-rate bonds**. Buying floating-rate bonds allows someone to immediately fill up the debt of one or more deposits using their own money, and in exchange they would receive the yield generated by those deposits. Given that each 88mph deposit would generate enough yield to cover its own deficit as long as the average interest rate during the deposit period stays above 75% of the initial value, a bond buyer would earn a profit as long as the interest rate doesn't drop by more than 25%.
正因如此，88mph还提供另一种**浮动利率债券**机制。通过购买浮动利率债券，某人可以立即用他们自己的钱弥补一笔或多笔存款的收益赤字，作为交换，他们可以得到这部分存款产生的额外收益。只要存期内平均利率保持在初始利率的75%以上，88mph平台上的每笔存款就能产生足够的收益来弥补其赤字，那么只要利率下降不超过25%，债券买家就能够获得利润。
Not only do floating-rate bonds significantly reduces the risk of depositing into 88mph, it also provides a brand new financial product that allows users to **long the interest rates of lending protocols**. It's similar to some other products that allows people to long and short interest rates ([LSDai](https://lsdai.market/)), except 88mph's floating-rate bonds provides a profit even if the interest rate drops (as long as it doesn't drop by more than 25%), and provides even more profits if the interest rate rises. It's like leverage-longing the interest rate!
浮动利率债券不仅大大降低了88mph平台的投资风险，同时也提供了一种全新的金融产品，允许用户根据行情**判断投资平台的利率走势**。这有点类似于那些允许用户看涨或看跌利率的平台([LSDai](https://lsdai.market/))，不同的是，即便利率下跌（只要下降不超过25%），88mph的浮动利率债券依旧能提供回报，如果利率上涨，其回报值会更高。这就像是对利率进行杠杆调节。
## Interest rate model
## 利率模型
At the moment, 88mph uses a linear model for determining the fixed interest rate offered to depositors. 88mph keeps track of the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the underlying yield protocol's APY over roughly a monthly window, and offers 75% of the EMA as the fixed rate.
当前88mph平台用以决定固定利率值的线性模型是指数平均数指标（Exponential Moving Average）。平台会跟踪观察基础收益平台的指数平均数指标大约一个月的变化情况，以该指标的75%作为固定利率值。
We have plans to implement more sophisticated interest rate models in the future that take into account paramters such as the pool surplus/debt, floating-rate volatility, pool total deposit, and so on.
我们未来计划采用更加精确成熟的利率模型，能够把池盈余/负债状况，浮动利率波动情况，池资金总量等参数也考虑进来。
## Towards structured products
## 向结构化产品迈进
The first line of products offered by 88mph could allow us or another protocol to build structured products on top of our first layer, **guaranteeing the capital** or a significant portion of such to maturity.
88mph平台的首支产品线允许我们或其他平台在我们的基础上搭建结构化产品网络，**保证资金总量**，对于我们的产品走向成熟来说是很关键的部分。
We could imagine a mechanism that gives rise to this structure by the combination of a fixed income instrument and the use of derivatives, in this case in particular, an option (eg [hegic.co](https://www.hegic.co)).
我们可以想象这样一种机制：固定利率收益产品和衍生产品组合共同搭建起这个结构网，在这种情况下，这尤其是一种选择(eg [hegic.co](https://www.hegic.co)).。
As far as we know, there is nothing like that in DeFi, so it could be a new market segment to explore after stabilizing our first layer of products.
据我们所知，当下DeFi市场还没有出现这种产品组合，因此这种组合有望占据新的市场份额，在稳定我们首支产品线之后继续探索。
## Interoperability through Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
通过NFTs实现协同工作
88mph represents deposits and bonds using ERC-721 standard non-fungible tokens. This means that users can transfer them between accounts, buy or sell them on exchanges, put wrappers around them to add more features, and more! The limit is your imagination.
88mph的资金和债券使用ERC-721标准的NFTs，这意味着用户能够直接使用其转账或者进行买卖交易，或者增加更多产品特性包装成其他代币，一切皆有可能！
Some possible use cases:
一些可实现的玩法：
- Deposited a lot of money into 88mph, but suddenly need cash? And you still want your deposit to generate profit? Well, you can take out a loan on lending platforms like [RocketNFT](https://medium.com/@AlexMasmej/introducing-rocket-get-a-loan-against-your-nfts-f67b1b5738f0) using your deposit NFT as collateral, and pay it back once you withdraw your deposit. Magic!
- 如果你已经把一大笔钱存入88mph平台，但是突然急用现金，而且你还想你的存款继续产生收益？可以，你可以在第三方借贷平台（如[RocketNFT](https://medium.com/@AlexMasmej/introducing-rocket-get-a-loan-against-your-nfts-f67b1b5738f0)）进行贷款，使用你存款的NFT作为抵押，在你期满取出存款时再还上这笔贷款。这个绝了！
- You can wrap your bond NFT with an ERC20 token to sell it out fractionally.
- 你可以用ERC20代币包装你所持债券的NFT，再分散卖出去。
- Or simply attach a creation of your favorite NFT-artist.
- 或者只用你最喜欢的NFT艺术家作品作为你的令牌图案也很棒。
